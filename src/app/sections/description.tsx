                    Since 2019, I've been living my dream as a game developer,
                    turning my lifelong love for gaming into a career. Creating
                    games, whether refining existing ones or starting from
                    scratch, has been incredibly fulfilling and has really
                    shaped my growth. Detail-oriented and always looking for
                    ways to optimize, these are the skills that drive my work.{" "}
