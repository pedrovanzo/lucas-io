This project was mainly about challenging myself with C++, a language I genuinely enjoy, and getting hands-on with a different game engine."

I wanted something simple, a place where I could mess things up freely, learn from those mistakes, and crash the engine—a lot. And believe me, I did plenty of crashing.<br>Working with Flax was pretty interesting. First, it's incredibly FAST, but also quite challenging and different from Unity. Compilation times and jumping in and out of play mode are lightning-quick, which made testing super fun. On the downside, Flax uses node-based systems for materials and particles, which I found complicated and a bit restrictive."

Instead of a detailed plan, I just started experimenting with making the ship's movement feel good. Along the way, I encountered several frustrating bugs, unexpected crashes, and issues like having to recompile on cold starts. Another small frustration was needing to use C# for UI, since Flax doesn't let you handle UI directly in C++. Still, figuring out how to bridge communication between C++ and C# scripts was pretty satisfying."

While it seemed simple at first, I quickly realized that synchronizing player actions over the network and ensuring smooth gameplay was more challenging than expected. The enemy AI, however, was the most complex aspect. While basic behaviors were easy to implement, making them fair, dynamic, and networked added significant complexity. Tasks like target switching and synchronizing AI behaviors across the network proved particularly difficult, leading me to simplify the game and drop the cooperative aspect. Animation was another area where I gained valuable knowledge. Using Unity's Animation Rigging package, I was able to dynamically control character bones, allowing both the player and enemy characters to aim at targets realistically. This small but impactful addition enhanced the game's polish and immersion."

Although Shared Mode isn't ideal for PvP shooters, I adapted by designing the shooting mechanics to ensure fairness, if one player's hit didn't register, the other player wouldn't take damage. While this made the gameplay feel laggy during testing, it was a reasonable compromise for my first attempt."
