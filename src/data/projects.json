Eventually, I changed the name to 'Asteroid Belt' for pretty obvious (and admittedly not super creative) reasons. This project was mainly about challenging myself with C++, a language I genuinely enjoy, and getting hands-on with a different game engine."

I wanted something simple, a place where I could mess things up freely, learn from those mistakes, and crash the engine—a lot. And believe me, I did plenty of crashing.<br>Working with Flax was pretty interesting. First, it's incredibly FAST, but also quite challenging and different from Unity. Compilation times and jumping in and out of play mode are lightning-quick, which made testing super fun. On the downside, Flax uses node-based systems for materials and particles, which I found complicated and a bit restrictive."

                "description": "About the game itself, I knew I wanted something space-themed with a controllable ship, but honestly, designing games isn't my strongest area. Instead of a detailed plan, I just started experimenting with making the ship's movement feel good. Along the way, I encountered several frustrating bugs, unexpected crashes, and issues like having to recompile on cold starts. Another small frustration was needing to use C# for UI, since Flax doesn't let you handle UI directly in C++. Still, figuring out how to bridge communication between C++ and C# scripts was pretty satisfying."
